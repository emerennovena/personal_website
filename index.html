        <h2>About</h2>
            <p class="fontsize">Hi, I'm Emerentia Novena. <br />
                I've always been driven by curiosity and a love for learning, which has taken me across disciplines and continents —
                from studying Business Marketing in Canada, to exploring Languages and Literature in Taiwan, and now diving into
                Information Technology in Scotland. I’ve taught Indonesian for almost two years, and in that time, I discovered how
                much I enjoy making ideas clear and engaging — a skill that also led me to an interest in UX/UI design.
                While my current studies are in IT, I’m passionate about combining my background in communication, culture,
                and technology to create user-centered digital experiences. I don’t fit neatly into one box — and that’s my strength.
                I bring a global perspective, interdisciplinary thinking, and a deep curiosity to everything I do.
                I’m still exploring exactly where I’ll land, but I know I want to build things that help people connect,
                learn, and feel understood.
            </p>

                I have native fluency in English and Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian), and can speak in conversational Chinese. I
                speak a little bit of Korean as well.
